# Welcome

The Tron Machine is a program developed at the Erik Dent Research Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The software counts neurons and quantifies their migration in image stack files from confocal microscopy. The program analyzes neurons using common image manipulation techniques, including erosion, Gaussian blur, and thresholding.
